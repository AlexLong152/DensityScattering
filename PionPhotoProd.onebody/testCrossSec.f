c     hgrie Oct 2022: v2.0 fewbody-Compton
c     hgrie Aug 2020: for usesymmetry.and.Mzp=0.andMz=0, Resultyx and Resultyx not calculated
c             They must be zero by symmetry, see manu-script "Compton Densities Approach" p.53
c     new Aug 2020, based on 3He density codes with the following datings/changes:
c     hgrie May 2018: produce onebody amplitudes from 1Ndensities.

c     Does output of multiple angles & energies to same output file work? May need adjusting output file name.

c     CHANGES:
c
c     hgrie Oct 2022: eliminated mistake in computation of ResultXYXY(): these used to go over ALL twoMzp, twoMzp.
c     That is wrong when one uses usesymmetry() of the amplitudes. In that case, the New Version computes now 2*(2Snucl+1)²
c     independent cartesian ResultXYXY(). However, transcarttosphere() translates them into 2*(2Snucl+1)² +2 spherical amplitudes
c     using that Resultxy=Resultyx=0 for Mzp=Mz=0! 
c     
c     hgrie Aug/Sep 2020: rewrote makedensityfilename() to deal with extracting densities from a .gz or downloading from server
c     hgrie June 2018: renamed "parity" to "symmetry -- see notes in usesymmetry+*.f
c       
c     hgrie May 2018: version 1 based on traditional main.onebody.f
c      
c           All quantum numbers which start with "two" run over integers
c                  Examples:
c                     twoMz,twoMzp: magnetic quantum numbers of in/out target nucleus, times 2.
c                     twoSnucl: 2 x spin of target nucleus
c           For all such variables, run over 2xQM values.
c                  Examples:
c                     in do-loops: twoMz runs from +twoSnucl to -twoSnucl, in steps of -2
c                     in array: Resultxx(twoMzp,twoMz) runs over   (-twoSnucl:twoSnucl,-twoSnucl:twoSnucl)
c
c     This numbering agrees with Andreas' assignments of magnetic quantum numbers.
c     In ARRAYs, this means a slight waste of space since we leave many array entries unused.
c     Example S=1/2: 2x2=4 entries needed, but array is (-1:1,-1:1): 3x3=9  : 225% of needed size
c     Example S=1:   3x3=9 entries needed, but array is (-2:2,-2:2): 5x5=25 : 280% of needed size
c
c     Still, our arrays are for small nuclei -- we do not really waste a lot. Not a time/storage issue.
c
c     hgrie May 2018: outsourced symmetry+output into sub routine outputroutine(), identical for onebody and twobody
c      
c     Implemented symmetry for arbitrary nucleon spin:
c     Use Mzp>=0, and for Mzp=0, run only over Mz>=0
c     -- that's still 2 more than necessary since ME(+0->+0) = ME(-0->-0) and ME(+0->-0) = ME(-0->+0)
c     but it's good enough, saving lots of CPU time.
